####Openly Mappy
Diana Shkolnikov (@dianashk), Mapzen, spent time discussing open source data and tools created by her and her colleagues at Mapzen for utilizing such data.  Mapzen is an open source mapping lab, focusing on core components of geo platforms, including search, rendering, navigation, and open source data. People alike can access free data through a variety of sources such as: [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Openaddresses.io](http://openaddresses.io/), and Mapzen’s own data portal: [Who’s On First](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com). Mapzen builds and provides a variety of tools as services, but also allows for developers to easily access and setup the tools for personal usage.  Among these services is a search tool for modern geocoding, transforming names/addresses into geographic coordinates, and vice-versa. Another service discussed was Mapzen’s Turn-by-Turn: a routing service for applications based on the OSM road network data, that can provide directions anywhere in the world.  Information about Mapzen and numerous other services can be found at: https://mapzen.com. 


####Python and GIS: Improving Your Workflow
John Reiser (@johnreiser), Rowan University, spent time discussing the power of Python scripting and how to better leverage GIS projects using Python.  As of December 2015 (TIOBE Index), the Python language was rated as the 4th most popular programming language, in part, due to its functionality and flexibility.  Python maintains a strong community of support and continued development, and can be easily integrated into various operating systems and GISs.  For GIS, Python can extend ArcGIS functionality by creating standalone scripts for enabling scheduled task and improving ETL (extract, transform, and load) tasks.  ETL processes can be rather tedious, thus Python can help compile, clean up, and load data straight to your database.   Various modules have been created to support web data retrieval and extraction, allowing users to access data through a single Python script.  More information regarding learning Python can be found at: [Code.org](https://code.org) or [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).  ESRI also offers web courses in Python development (http://www.esri.com/training/main)
